# Project Euler Solutions
All of these solutions are from [nayuki's](https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions) gracious hands. I just want to get better at Python by studying them.

## More to annotate:
- lambda (in 47)
- Decorators (memoize, also 47)
- Try/except/pass
- What is ^ (59)? And what are bitwise ops (61, 90, 315, 150)?
- Raise ValueError (60, assertionError 107)
- fraction.Fraction and QuadraticSurd (66)
- Tuple (86)
- Set (87, 107, 125)
- Recursion (88, 96)
- Nested for loops, pythonically (91)
- Assert?? (96)
- And never forget the [0] * 100 trick!
- “Dynamic Programming” (115)
- Ternary expressions (120)
- How does map work? (128)
- islice (132)

- isdisjoint (two lists? 215)
- while True (225)
- np.zeros, np.cumsum (150)
- break and continue (142)
- .count (135)
- zip (98)
